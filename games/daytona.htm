            Daytona USA is an arcade game by SEGA. It was originally released in
            arcades in March 1994. In addition to having a start of the art 3d
            workstation powering its graphics, it was one of the first arcade
            games to include a force feedback system. These impressive features
            made it very difficult to port accurately to the home environment.
            It was only properly ported on 2011/10/26, when it released on Xbox
            Live Arcade for the Microsoft Xbox 360. This was the first port with
            arcade authentic graphics. Via use of the Xbox 360 Wireless
            Force Feedback Steering Wheel, you can also enjoy the authentic
            driving experience. It's one of my favorite racing games, as someone
            who doesn't normally play them.
